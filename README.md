Hey! I'm just a random girl on here. I'm *far* from being the most skilled at programming, but I make a bunch of stuff in Python. It's *mostly* just Discord bots and Discord Python libraries, but sometimes I expand out a bit and dip my toes into other places, too.

Most people know me for my contributions to [`NAFF`](https://github.com/NAFTeam/NAFF), an extensible, easy to use, and fast Discord Python library. I'm a maintainer there, largely helping out with prefixed (text) commands and quality-of-life features, but I tend to jump around on what exactly I'm doing depending on my interests. I also maintain [`tansy`](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/tansy), which are a set of experiments for NAFF - currently, it includes a different way of declaring slash commands in NAFF that some users may like.

I've also worked extensively with [`interactions.py`](https://github.com/interactions-py/library), being a developer and maintaining [a version of `molter`](https://github.com/interactions-py/molter) (a framework for prefixed commands) for it just for fun.

Of course, I contribute to other Discord Python places, too! [Many](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/pull/63) [`discord.py`](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/147) [forks](https://github.com/iDevision/enhanced-discord.py/commit/fcb2d707a1445fefb22311dc5ffe1b47d0b9bf55) have at least one PR from me. I'm also willing to work with many other wrappers if my interest is ever captured by them, as long as they aren't rude.

Other than that, I also maintain a couple of bots here and there. They're all pretty small and have somewhat niche usages, but they're the main reason why I got into Discord Python library development in the first place.
These include:
- [Realms Playerlist Bot](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/RealmsPlayerlistBot), a bot that helps out owners of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Realms by showing a log of players who have joined and left.
- [Ultimate Investigator](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/UltimateInvestigator), a bot made to help automate investigations during Danganronpa roleplays.
- [Cherub](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/Cherub), an experimental utility bot to do tasks usually not found in other bots.
- Some other ones that I won't link here, but they're like a second away from being looked at.

Beyond that, there's also miscellaneous projects like [my time zone getter](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/GetTimeZone) and [my fork of `mc-texture-changes`](https://github.com/AstreaTSS/mc-texture-changes).

Feel free to take a look around my repos! If you need to contact me, I'd prefer Discord (Astrea#7171) since I'm *very* active on there. Otherwise, enjoy!
